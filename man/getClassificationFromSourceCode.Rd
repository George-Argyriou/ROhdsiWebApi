\usage{
getClassificationFromSourceCode(baseUrl, sourceCode, sourceVocabularyId,
  targetVocabularyId, targetConceptClassIds = c(),
  relationshipId = "Has ancestor of", minDistance = 0,
  maxDistance = NULL, selectOnPriority = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI".}

\item{sourceCode}{A single source code}

\item{sourceVocabularyId}{The name of the source vocabulary id for the source code (e.g. ICD9CM, ICD10CM)}

\item{targetVocabularyId}{The classification vocabulary id to map to}

\item{targetConceptClassIds}{(OPTIONAL) An array of the concept class id(s) of the classification term}

\item{relationshipId}{The name of the concept relationship to filter by. Refer to the concept_relationship table for a list of options.}

\item{minDistance}{The minimum hierarchy distance from the source code's standard concepts 
for the classification term. 
Default is 0 (meaning there is no minimum distance)}

\item{maxDistance}{The maximum hierarchy distance from the source code's standard concepts 
for the classification term. 
Default is NULL (meaning there is no maximum distance)}

\item{selectOnPriority}{If TRUE and targetConceptClassIds consists of 2 or more selections, 
we will select one classification term only, using the targetConceptClassIds as a priority list.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the classification terms
}
\description{
Get classification term from source code
}
\details{
For a source code, obtain mapped classification term(s) by traversing from source code to
standard concept to classification term.
